    "I began by understanding the requirements and constraints. The goal was to identify if there were duplicate values in the tree, and if so, return the one closest to the root. My initial approach was to implement an iterative BFS solution using a queue, as this method would naturally traverse the tree level by level, ensuring that the first duplicate encountered was the closest to the root.\n",
    "I implemented the BFS approach and incorporated a set to track seen values. This allowed for efficient detection of duplicates with an overall time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n) in the worst case. Printing the queue's state at each step helped me visualize the traversal process, ensuring correctness and enhancing my understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "While reviewing Olga's submission, I first focused on understanding the requirements. The value of n was not obvious but looking at the examples, it was clear that it should be the max value in the set. Also, the case of an empty list was not considered.\n",
    "After understanding the expectations, I first reviewed for any major issues such as incorrect code or missing conditions.\n",
    "After verifying that the code runs and produces the expected results, I looked at the time-space complexity to determine if the O value was optimal. Finally, I looked at user readability and clarity of the code. I looked for clear variable names, concise comments, and a logical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the code performed well with the initial submission but needed to address some edge cases and improve readability."
